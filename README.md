# Drag-and-Drop Website Builder Documentation

## Overview

This project is a **drag-and-drop website builder** that enables users to create a webpage layout by dragging elements (Text, Image, Button) from a sidebar onto a canvas. The interface is designed to be intuitive and fully responsive, ensuring usability across both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

1. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Users can drag elements from a sidebar and drop them onto a canvas.
2. **Persistent State**: Elements retain their position after being dropped.
3. **Mobile-Friendly**: Supports drag-and-drop interactions on touch devices.
4. **Scalability**: Built with flexibility to accommodate additional elements in the future.
5. **Smooth Animations**: Ensures a seamless user experience.

## Architecture

### **Component Structure**

- **App.js**: The main component that manages the state and drag events.
- **Sidebar.js**: Contains draggable elements (Text, Image, Button, etc.).
- **Canvas.js**: The workspace where users drop elements.
- **DraggableElement.js**: Represents individual items that can be dragged and dropped.

### **State Management**

- Uses **Reactâ€™s `useState` hook** to store placed elements dynamically.
- Updates the state when an element is dropped onto the canvas.

### **Drag-and-Drop Implementation**

- Uses `@dnd-kit/core` to handle drag interactions.
- Utilizes **both Mouse and Touch sensors** to support mobile devices.
- Assigns **unique IDs** to elements to track them individually.

### **Responsiveness Handling**

- Uses **CSS Flexbox and Grid** for a fluid, adaptable layout.
- Adjusts element placement dynamically for different screen sizes.
- Implements `TouchSensor` from `@dnd-kit/core` for mobile-friendly dragging.

## Tools Used

- **React.js**: Component-based structure for modular development.
- **@dnd-kit/core**: Provides smooth drag-and-drop interactions.
- **CSS (Flexbox & Media Queries)**: For responsive UI.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.

## Rationale Behind the Approach

### **1. User Experience (UX)**

- Dragging elements should feel **intuitive and smooth**.
- Users get **instant feedback** when elements are dropped.
- Ensures elements are **clearly visible** on different screen sizes.

### **2. Performance & Scalability**

- Uses **lightweight state management** (`useState`) for efficiency.
- Designed to support future **customization and new elements**.
- Can be extended to include **saving/loading layouts** from a backend.

## Installation & Usage

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js installed
- React environment setup
